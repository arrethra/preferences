##### Example from README #######

## This module enables automatical storage of values/preferences to a file
## when its values are set/changed*. These values are configured as the 
## attributes (named after your own choice) of the class Preferences. 
## Upon restarting of the program, these stored values are automatically 
## retrieved. The stored values are written down in the file in 
## recognisable format (JSON).
##
##     *Override through 'setattr', which means that methods such as 
##     list.append or dict.update do not trigger this automatic behavior,
##     where the value is stored to a file.
##
## It is possible to set defaults for these values quite easily. These 
## defaults are stored in the file as well. When the values change, these
## values can manually be reset to default with the method 
## 'reset_to_default(*args)'.
##
## It is also possible to incorporate automatic checks, that for example 
## can check the instance or format of the saved value automatically. 
## This requires overriding the method 'check_before_setting_attribute".
##
## For more information on all the methods and/or examples see the 
## docstring [help(Preferences)].
##
##
## Simple example:

from preferences import Preferences

prefs_defaults = { "X": 1,
                   "Y": 2 }
prefs = Preferences(defaults = prefs_defaults,
                    filename = "preferences_test.txt")

# At first use, attributes are initialized to default
# If previous uses set them at different values, the default value will 
# not override the 'different value'.
assert prefs.X == 1 and prefs.Y == 2                        # True

# By setting the following attributes, their new values are
# automatically stored into the file.
prefs.X = 3
prefs.Y = 4

# attributes can be defined without default values.
prefs.Z = 5

# RESTART program (re-initializing 'prefs' gives the same results as
#                  restarting. Since defaults are stored, you are not
#                  required to give them default values again. 
#                  However, when restarting the script, this is 
#                  usually unavoidable. )
prefs = Preferences(defaults = prefs_defaults,
                    filename = "preferences_test.txt")

# Old values have been remembered.
assert prefs.X == 3 and prefs.Y == 4 and prefs.Z == 5        # True

# Following method resets ALL values (if no arguments are given),
# although it will be unable to reset "Z", as it has no default.
prefs.reset_to_default() 
assert prefs.X == 1 and prefs.Y == 2 and prefs.Z == 5        # True

# If you'd like to remove the stored file, the following method
# would accomplish this. (This removes any old values!!)
prefs.delete_preferences_file()
